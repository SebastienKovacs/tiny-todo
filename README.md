This is a very simple todo programm for the gnome desktop. It is very much in developpement and not ready to be used. If you want to have a look at it
right now you will need to install the dependecies yourself and compile it with the makefile (and actually modify the makefile because I put an
absolute path for my postgresql library, hehe. Sorry for that, I'm having problems with pg_config on my machine.)
There really is not much more to say about this programm yet.
